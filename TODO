Proper name and icons

Wider data detection:
    author variable is especially affected by poor data availability.
    Perhaps application/ld+json handling

Localization:
    Add more languages. All compatible with the logic are fully eligible.
    Note that ie. Spanish template expects a custom localized date format,
    that would require logic exceptions.

    That would either require creating a popup or implementing settings to
    choose default language of operation, or both.
